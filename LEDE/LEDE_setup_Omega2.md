# LEDE

I followed this guide to setup the build toolchain

https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/cross-compiling.html

This is the .config file that I used to make the toolchain that I use to cross compile in ubuntu for Omega2

The archive is the compressed version of the result of the make. I keep it here as a backup as it takes forever to make + it hurts my poor laptop
